  Hi! Welcome to AMORA's web site***under construction***. Here you can see our [robots](robots/) be updated about our [projects](projects/) and who is the [people](people/) behind it.

  The Autonomous Mobile Robot Algorithms (AMORA) project aims to enable our Pioneer 3 robots to perform simple tasks autonomously. In order to do so, we plan to integrate state-of-the-art algorithms in path planning, navigation, SLAM, object recognition and others within the ROS framework.

<!--   You would normally put your [full name](about/) here and say something *smart* about yourself.

  This could also be the good place to say were you are coming from, what you [do for a living](work/) and maybe what you are [interested in](projects/). You might also be [writing](articles/) about stuff.

  But after all this is your site and I'm just a **placeholder text** so what would i know about some *home page content*. -->
